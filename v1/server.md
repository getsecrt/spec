# Server Runtime Specification (v1)

Status: Active for current implementation.

This document describes how the v1 server behaves at runtime. Unlike the API spec, this file covers internal behavior: storage operations, TTL enforcement mechanics, middleware, timeouts, and cleanup loops.

Source-of-truth code paths:

- `cmd/secrt-server/main.go`
- `internal/api/server.go`
- `internal/api/middleware.go`
- `internal/secrets/secrets.go`
- `internal/storage/postgres/postgres.go`
- `internal/database/migrations/001_initial.sql`
- `internal/database/migrations/002_add_owner_key.sql`

## 1. Scope

This spec is for server runtime behavior only:

- request handling and middleware
- auth, rate limits, and validation
- persistence and atomic claim semantics
- TTL and cleanup behavior

It is not the client crypto format spec. See:

- `spec/v1/envelope.md`

It is also not the CLI UX/argument spec. See:

- `spec/v1/cli.md`

## 2. Startup and Shutdown

On startup, the server:

1. Creates a root context canceled by `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`.
2. Loads `.env` automatically when `ENV != production`.
3. Loads config and initializes JSON logging (`slog`).
4. Opens Postgres and pings it.
5. Runs DB migrations before serving requests.
6. Starts HTTP server.
7. Starts a background expired-row cleanup ticker.

HTTP server timeouts:

- `ReadHeaderTimeout`: 5s
- `ReadTimeout`: 15s
- `WriteTimeout`: 15s
- `IdleTimeout`: 60s

On shutdown, the server performs graceful HTTP shutdown with a 10s timeout.

## 3. Database and Schema

Runtime database is Postgres (via `pgx` stdlib driver through `database/sql`).

Connection pool settings:

- max open conns: 10
- max idle conns: 10
- conn max lifetime: 30m

Primary tables:

- `secrets(id, claim_hash, envelope, expires_at, created_at, owner_key)`
- `api_keys(id, key_prefix, key_hash, scopes, created_at, revoked_at)`

Indexes:

- `secrets_expires_at_idx` for expiry-related queries
- `secrets_owner_key_idx` for owner-scoped usage queries

## 4. Middleware and Request Processing

Middleware stack order (outermost to innermost):

1. request logging
2. security headers
3. request ID
4. panic recovery
5. route handler

Security headers set on all responses:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

JSON responses always set:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Cache-Control: no-store`

Request IDs:

- Uses incoming `X-Request-Id` if provided.
- Otherwise generates 16 random bytes (hex encoded).
- Echoed back in `X-Request-Id` response header.

Logging fields:

- method, path, status, bytes, duration_ms, request_id (if present)

The server trusts `X-Forwarded-For` only when `RemoteAddr` is loopback (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`), extracting the leftmost IP for rate limiting. When not behind a trusted proxy, client identity uses `RemoteAddr` directly.

## 5. Route Surface (Current)

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /`
- `GET /s/{id}`
- `GET /robots.txt`
- `POST /api/v1/public/secrets`
- `POST /api/v1/secrets`
- `POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/claim`
- `POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/burn`

## 6. Auth and Authorization

Authenticated endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/secrets`
- `POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/burn`

Credential sources:

- `X-API-Key`
- `Authorization: Bearer <key>`

API key format:

- `sk_<prefix>.<secret>`

Verification model:

1. Parse prefix+secret.
2. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(pepper, prefix + ":" + secret)` (hex encoded).
3. Lookup by prefix.
4. Reject revoked keys.
5. Constant-time compare stored hash vs computed hash.

Notes:

- Missing or invalid keys return `401 unauthorized`.
- If `API_KEY_PEPPER` is unset, API-key auth cannot succeed.
- API key `scopes` are stored but not currently enforced by runtime handlers.

## 7. Ownership and Quota Model

The server tracks an internal `owner_key` for each secret:

- Public create: owner key is derived from client IP (`clientIP(r)`).
- Authenticated create: owner key is `apikey:<prefix>`.

This owner key drives policy only:

- per-owner active-secret quota checks
- per-owner active-byte quota checks
- owner-scoped burn authorization for authenticated secrets

Ownership metadata does not affect claim/decrypt semantics. Claim remains bearer-by-token.

## 8. Rate Limiting

Limiter implementation is an in-memory token bucket keyed by string.

Configured limits:

- Public create: `0.2 rps`, burst `4` (about 12/min, burst 4) keyed by client IP.
- Claim: `1.0 rps`, burst `10` keyed by client IP.
- Authenticated create: `2.0 rps`, burst `20` keyed by API key prefix.
- Burn: no dedicated limiter in v1 (API key auth + owner checks apply).

Important runtime property:

- This is per-process, not distributed. Multi-instance deployments need a shared/global limiter for strict global limits.

## 9. Input Validation and Limits

Create request (`POST /api/v1/public/secrets`, `POST /api/v1/secrets`):

- Requires `Content-Type: application/json`
- Max body size: per-tier envelope limit + 16KiB overhead
  - Public: `PUBLIC_MAX_ENVELOPE_BYTES + 16KiB` (default `256KiB + 16KiB`)
  - Authenticated: `AUTHED_MAX_ENVELOPE_BYTES + 16KiB` (default `1MiB + 16KiB`)
- JSON unknown fields rejected
- Must contain valid `envelope` object JSON
- Envelope size checked against per-tier limit -> `400` with human-readable limit in message
- Must contain valid `claim_hash` (`base64url(sha256(...))` format)
- `ttl_seconds` rules:
  - default: 24h when omitted
  - accepted: any positive integer seconds up to 31536000 (1 year)
- per-owner quota checks:
  - secret count limit -> `429` (`"secret limit exceeded (max N active secrets)"`)
  - active stored bytes limit -> `413` (`"storage quota exceeded (limit <size>)"`)

All size and quota limits are configurable per server instance via environment variables. See the Policy Tiers section of the API spec.

Claim request (`POST /api/v1/secrets/{id}/claim`):

- Requires `Content-Type: application/json`
- Max body size: 8KiB
- JSON unknown fields rejected
- Requires non-empty `claim`
- Invalid claim token encoding/length is treated as `404` to reduce existence leaks

## 10. TTL and Expiry Semantics

TTL is enforced in two layers:

1. Logical enforcement on claim path (authoritative):
   - claim query only succeeds when `expires_at > now`
2. Background cleanup for storage hygiene:
   - periodic delete of expired rows

This means expired secrets are not claimable even if cleanup has not run yet.

## 11. Atomic One-Time Claim

One-time semantics are implemented in a single SQL statement:

- `DELETE FROM secrets ... WHERE id=$1 AND claim_hash=$2 AND expires_at>$3 RETURNING ...`

Properties:

- At most one successful claim for a given secret.
- Wrong claim token, expired secret, or already-claimed secret all resolve to not found behavior.
- API returns `404` for all those cases.

## 12. Owner-Scoped Burn

Burn authorization uses authenticated owner keys.

- Handler authenticates API key, computes owner key `apikey:<prefix>`, and passes that to storage.
- Storage delete condition includes both `id` and `owner_key`.

Postgres query shape:

- `DELETE FROM secrets WHERE id=$1 AND owner_key=$2`

Properties:

- API keys can only burn secrets they created.
- Missing ID and wrong owner are indistinguishable to clients (`404`).

## 13. Background Expired-Secret Reaper

A best-effort cleanup goroutine runs every 5 minutes:

- Calls `DeleteExpired(nowUTC)` with a 10s context timeout.
- Deletes rows where `expires_at <= now`.

Important:

- Reaper is not required for correctness of one-time claim behavior.
- Reaper failures are currently ignored (best-effort housekeeping).

## 14. Error Mapping (Current)

Common responses:

- `400` invalid JSON / field/type/validation issues
- `401` missing or invalid API key
- `404` secret not found, expired, already claimed, wrong/invalid claim token, or burn not owned
- `405` wrong method
- `413` storage quota exceeded
- `429` rate limited
- `500` unexpected server or storage errors

## 15. Logging and Secret-Safety Notes

Current server logging records metadata (method/path/status/bytes/duration/request_id), not request bodies.

Operational requirement remains:

- Do not add plaintext, passphrases, claim tokens, or envelope payloads to logs.

## 16. Alignment Rule

When this server spec is changed, implementation and tests must be updated in the same change set.
